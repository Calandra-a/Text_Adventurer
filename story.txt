You‘re on a passenger airliner flying coach over the Pacific Ocean when you begin to feel heavy turbulence. For about 5 minutes you fly through this with no word from the pilot and only hear nervous chatter from the other passengers and visibly shaken attendants when suddenly you hear a defining bang and a see a bright flash and then hear metal shearing away as the whole wing tears off ripping a gaping hole into the fuselage… your worst fear is realized you’re going to crash into the ocean. With the plane crashing to the earth you manage to unclip your seat beat knowing you’re going to need to escape the second the plane hits the water… then it happens you crash into the ocean, moments later… a large suitcase smashes into the back of your head knocking you unconscious. The next day you awaken on a sandy beach the sun beating down you, you feel a large knot covered in coagulated blood on the back of your head and you realize you're stranded.
