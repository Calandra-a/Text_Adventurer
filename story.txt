You‘re on a passenger airliner flying coach over the Pacific Ocean
when you begin to feel heavy turbulence. For about 5 minutes you fly through 
this with now word from the pilot and to only hear never chatter form the other 
passengers and visibly shaken attendants when suddenly you hear a defining bang a 
bright flash and then you hear metal shearing away and the whole wing tears off ripping a 
gaping hole into the fuselage… your worst fear is realized you’re going to crash 
into the ocean. With the plane crashing to the earth you manage to unclip your 
seat beat knowing you’re going to need to escape the second the plane hits 
the water… then it happens you crash into the ocean, moments later… a large suit case
comes smashing into the back of your head knocking you unconscious. The next day you 
awaken on a sandy beach the sun beating down you, you feel a large knot covered in coagulated
blood on the back of your head and you realize your stranded.
